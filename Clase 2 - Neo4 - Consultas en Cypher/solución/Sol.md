# Neo4j Cypher Exercises

## Use Case 1: Vertex Degree
**Problem:** For each vertex compute its in-degree and out-degree. The result set is a list of vertices and both values. Those vertices that do not have outgoing edges and/or incoming edges, must not appear in the answer.

**Solution:**
```cypher
MATCH (u:URL)
MATCH (u)-[r:REF]->()
MATCH ()-[r2:REF]->(u)
RETURN u.name, COUNT(r2) AS IN, COUNT(r) AS OUT;
```

## Use Case 2: Vertex Degree variation
**Problem:** For each vertex calculate its in-degree and out-degree. The result set is a list of all vertices in the graph, together with the two values above, for each vertex. Those vertices that do not have outgoing edges and/or incoming edges, must appear in the answer with value "0".

**Solution:**
```cypher
MATCH (u:URL)
OPTIONAL MATCH (u)-[r:REF]->()
OPTIONAL MATCH ()-[r2:REF]->(u)
RETURN u.name, CONCAT(COUNT(r2), COUNT(r));
```

## Use Case 3: Calculating a maximum value
**Problem:** Find the maximum vertex in-degree.

**Solution:**
```cypher
MATCH (u:URL)
OPTIONAL MATCH (u)-[rI:REF]->()
WITH u, COUNT(rI) AS cI
OPTIONAL MATCH ()-[rO:REF]->(u)
WITH u, COUNT(rO) AS cO, cI 
RETURN u.name, cI, cO
```

## Use Case 4: Find influential nodes
**Problem:** Find the subgraph which contains nodes whose in-degree is maximal in the graph (you should obtain only one node). Do the same for the out-degree (you should obtain four nodes).

**Solution:**
```cypher
MATCH (u:URL)
OPTIONAL MATCH (u)-[r:REF]->()
WITH u, COUNT(r) AS c
WITH MAX(c) AS maxC
MATCH (u:URL)
OPTIONAL MATCH (u)-[r:REF]->()
WITH u, COUNT(r) AS c, maxC
WHERE c = maxC
RETURN u.name, c

MATCH (u:URL)
OPTIONAL MATCH ()-[r:REF]->(u)
WITH u, COUNT(r) AS c
WITH MAX(c) AS maxC
MATCH (u:URL)
OPTIONAL MATCH ()-[r:REF]->(u)
WITH u, COUNT(r) AS c, maxC
WHERE c = maxC
RETURN u.name, c

```

## Use Case 5: Distance between nodes
**Problem:** For each pair of vertices, calculate the distance, i.e. the shortest simple path between them (without repeated edges in the path). Do not show the distance between two disconnected nodes (infinite distance). Exclude paths when source and target are the same node.

**Solution:**
```cypher
MATCH (u:URL)
MATCH (u2:URL)
WHERE u <> u2
WITH u, u2
OPTIONAL MATCH path = (u)-[*1..]->(u2)
WITH u, u2, path
ORDER BY length(path)
WITH u, u2, collect(path)[0] AS shortestPath
RETURN u.name, u2.name, length(shortestPath)
```

## Use Case 6: Distance between nodes using Cypher function
**Problem:** Solve the query in Use Case 5, but using the shortestPath built-in Cypher function. It has one parameter that represents a pattern path and returns the shortest path that matches this pattern. If there exists more than one shortest path, it returns any of them.

**Solution:**
```cypher
MATCH (u:URL)
MATCH (u2:URL)
WHERE u<>u2
with u, u2
Optional match p = shortestPath((u)-[*1..]-(u2))
return u.name, u2.name, length(p)
```

## Use Case 7: Diameter
**Problem:** Compute the diameter of the graph, i.e. the longest distance between two nodes in the graph (excluding disconnected pairs of nodes).

**Solution:**
```cypher
MATCH (u:URL)
MATCH (u2:URL)
WHERE u<>u2
with u, u2
Optional match p = shortestPath((u)-[*1..]-(u2))
WITH length(p) As l
ORDER BY l DESC
return collect(l)[0]
```

## Use Case 8: webgraph3
**Problem:** Repeat use cases 1 to 7 using the webgraph3 database, which represents the same information as the corresponding relational database in Activity 1.

**Solution:**
```cypher
// Your solutions here
```

## Use Case 9: Paths
**Problem:** Compute all the 1, 2, 3, and n-hops in the graph, and compare against the results obtained using PostgreSQL in Activity 1. Note: start with "limit X", increasing "X" to prevent that the algorithm runs indefinitely.

**Solution:**
```cypher
// Your solution here
```
```

This format provides a clean structure with each use case clearly defined with its problem statement and a dedicated space for your Cypher solutions. You can fill in your solutions as you work through each exercise.
